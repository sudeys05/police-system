 Duplicate Function Declarations
Fixed duplicate registerMongoDBRoutes function in server/mongodb-routes.js - removed the second declaration that was causing "Identifier 'registerMongoDBRoutes' has already been declared" error
Fixed duplicate seedGeofiles function in server/seed-geofiles.js - removed the duplicate function declaration
Fixed duplicate imports in server/vite.js - removed duplicate import statements for createViteServer, path, and other modules
2. Missing Dependencies
Installed all required TypeScript type definitions with this command:
npm install @types/passport @types/compression @types/dotenv @types/helmet @types/memoizee @types/mongodb @types/mongoose @types/ws @types/cors @types/connect-pg-simple @types/connect-mongo @types/passport-local @types/express @types/express-session @types/multer @types/bcryptjs
3. React Component Props Issue
Fixed undefined cases prop error in Dashboard component by adding a default empty array (cases = []) to prevent the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')" error
Updated App.jsx to properly initialize and pass the cases array to Dashboard component
4. Database Connection Issues
Fixed MongoDB connection by ensuring proper async/await handling in mongodb-connection.js
Fixed evidence routes registration to properly handle the database connections
Resolved route registration conflicts by cleaning up duplicate route declarations
5. Import/Export Issues
Fixed ES module imports across multiple server files
Resolved circular dependency issues between different route files
Cleaned up duplicate variable declarations in various files
Current Status
✅ App is now running successfully on port 5000
✅ MongoDB Atlas connection established
✅ All routes properly registered
✅ Frontend React app loading without errors
✅ Sample data seeded successfully

The app is now fully functional with:

Dashboard with case statistics
MongoDB database connectivity
Evidence management system
Occurrence Book functionality
All authentication flows working
The main issues were syntax errors from duplicate declarations and missing type definitions, which prevented the TypeScript compilation and caused runtime errors in the React components.
